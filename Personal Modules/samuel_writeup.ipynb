Immediately, we discovered that 2020 and 2021 have the exact same data. After using the original dataset to verify that this is indeed the case, we believe that this is due to government cannot collect data from people during the covid-19 pandemic, so the data was used for the consecutive two years. Other than that, we can see that there does to seem some effect of year on the percentage of diabetes patients among adults. Specifically, the year 2022 has generally lower diabete rates across all states than previous years.\n",
    "Also, we can see that there seems to be some significance relationship between state and percentage of diabete patients among adults. Specifically, southern states seem to have higher percentage of diabetes patients among adults than any other regions, but West Virginia has the highest percentage of diabetes patients among adults than any other states."

Specifically, California, Texas, and Nevada are missing all three years of data from 2019 to 2021. These are some of the most populated states in Amercica, so we should definitely take that into consideration.\n",
    "We can see that the distribution of this variable, in fact, is quite different from our reponse variable, percentage of diabetes patients in adults. States like New York, South Dakota, Washington, and Oregon, which don't have very high percentage of diabetes patients in adults, have much higher percentage of Gestational diabetes among women with a recent live birth. This is quite different from our assumption, and it requires further inspection when we fit the machine learning model."

We can immediately see that native Americans of Oklahoma, a state where native Americans reside traditionally, have the highest Diabetes Ketoacidosis Mortality Rate (per 100,000) across the years where the data is available. While other states generally have similar mortality rates, Kentucky and Nevada are two states that constantly have higher Diabetes Ketoacidosis Mortality Rate for both white and black demographics."
