# Analytics Dashboard with GCP implementation
 STATS 507 Final Project at the University of Michigan. By: Han Yang, Haoyu Zhao, Jingyan Zhang, Samuel Tan, Yingxi Chen.

The goal of this project is to visualize the dataset about diabetes in the United States and predict the percentage of diabetes patients of adults in the US. The full dataset is the U.S. Chronic Diseases Indicators dataset, and the group obtained a subset of the dataset that is about diabetes. This project is ready to be deployed on Google Cloud Platform.

The main program is in main.py, with three modules: data_cleaning_module.py for data cleaning, utility_module.py for the utility functions used in prediction of the model, and visualization_and_prediction_module.py for functions used in visualization of EDA.
The other models that were not chosen are in the Model_Selection.ipynb file.
